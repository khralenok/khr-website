# Khralenok Website
My website [khralenok.com](https://khralenok.com/) is a blog where I publish short format posts with illustrations. 

I working on this project to explore if Go can replace PHP and WordPress in my content distribution routine. Along the way I expect to learn deeper Nginx, Docker and the rest involved technologies.

You can find this project useful, If decide to build selfhosted replacement for your Threads or Telegram channel. 

However, I encourage you to keep in mind this project I build this project for personal use it can contain serious security issues.
