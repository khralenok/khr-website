($$ Last Friday, I nearly dropped a project I hadn't even started â€” just because it felt too complex.

Then I thought: with that mindset, I'd never build anything cooler than a calculator.

So I broke it into doable parts â€” and today, I finally started working on the AllWallets database.

It's the first step toward building the full app. $$,

($$ Midweek AllWallets API update:

ðŸŸ¢ Refined the auth logic from my previous API â€” this time, I didn't miss a uniqueness constraint for usernames ðŸ˜œ.

ðŸŸ¢ Added wallet creation logic. Now, users can create wallets and become admins of them. It's a basic setup for features coming soon.

ðŸŸ¢ Built a profile endpoint that returns user info along with their wallets. It was my first time joining two tables in a single query â€” learned a bit more about SQL.

Hope your week is going great â€” see ya! $$,

There's a gap between simple apps and pro accounting tools â€” and it's one I want to explore.

I'm just learning for now â€” not testing demand yet. But it's still worth solving a real problem. ðŸ§© $$,
